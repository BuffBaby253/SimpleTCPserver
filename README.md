# Simple TCP Server
I was playing around with C++ trying to make something else but after some debugging and modifications I found out this simplified script of my original idea could be a TCP server that listens for incoming connections on port 6667 and sends a response to the client when a connection is established, the response is a string of bytes that represents a PNG file signature
